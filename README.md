Program takes a string as an argument and displays the name of the matching quad and its dimensions. 

If the argument is not a quad the program prints "Not a quad function" message.
If there is more than one quad matches, the program must display them all alphabetically ordered and separated by a ||.

Examples how to run the program using piping:

echo AC| go run .
or if you want to run executable:
echo AC| ./quadchecker

./quadC 1 1 | go run .
or if you want to run executable:
./quadC 1 1 | ./quadchecker
